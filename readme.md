# Aion Relic Calculator

This is a quick and dirty relic splitting calculator for Aion. 
It supports adding initial AP values for each player.

To add Relics, use the initials for the relic names as shorthands:

- Major Ancient Crown: ``mc``
- Greater Ancient Crown: ``gc``
- Ancient Crown: ``nc`` (normal crown)
- Lesser Ancient Crown: ``lc``


 - Goblets (Chalices in Classic EU): ``mg, gg, ng, lg``
 - Seals: ``ms, gs, ns, ls``
 - Icons: ``mi, gi, ni, li``

At the end of relic input, simpy type ``done``.

Example:

``
li li li mi ls ns gs lg mg nc done
``
